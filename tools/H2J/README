Instructions on using the JDF generator.

****************************************
*** Building:
The toolchain consists of a bash file "getDeps.sh", a perl file "prettyPrint.pl"
and a binary file "kill".  To generate the binary, just type

$> make kill

There is an additional program, "smpss_to_petit" but it is very crude and we
are in the process of rewriting it.


****************************************
*** Input:
The input to the toolchain is a petit file (until we finish the tool that
generates petit from an even higher level representation).
Example petit files exist for LU, and left/right looking cholesky in the
files LU.t, cholesky_ll.t and cholesky_rl.t respectively.


****************************************
*** Execution
First we need the unrefined dependencies.

$> bash getDeps.sh FILE.t > FILE.deps

will generate those and put them into FILE.deps. Afterwards we run:

$> ./kill FILE.dep > FILE.jdf

which kills the dead dependencies, computes the IN deps from the OUT deps and
processes the sets that Omega generates to create the parameters of the JDF
tasks.


****************************************
*** Example

$> bash getDeps.sh LU.t | ./kill - > LU.jdf
