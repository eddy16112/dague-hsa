Parameter designation:
* IN, INOUT, SCRATCH, VALUE
* 2D issues: rectangular matrices, leading dimension
* Triangular upper/lower, diagonal
* banded
* more from BLAS and LAPACK

Function decorations:
* pragmas
* fake function declaration beefore:
static BFR_FUNC foo(IN a, OUT b);
int foo(double *a, double *b) { }
* fake function call inside:
int foo(double *a, double *b) {
  BFR_declare( IN, a, OUT b );
}

Language parsing:
* Complex numbers
* long long int
* mixing of declarations and code

Indexing:
* A[i, j] comma operator is already used in C/C++ so A[i, j] <=> A[j]
* A[i ; j] this introduces new syntax
* A(i, j) feels more like Fortran so maybe the user will expect indices starting with 1 not 0
* A(i, j, k, l) to select a tile and an item within a tile
* A({i, j}) almost legal C99: A((struct {int i, j;}){I, J})
* A({i, j, k, l}) almost legal C99: A((struct ijkl){I, J})

_Thread_local storage class in C and thread_local in C++
